Gongseri Catholic Church Imbued with

The soaring steeples symbolize piety, and many elements of these churches are built in beautiful mathematical proportions of integers. Gongseri Catholic Church in Asan, South Chungcheong Province, is a Gothic church in Korea. You cannot speak about the beauty of Korean churches without mentioning the Gongseri church. Seated on the hill of Gongseri, the church looks grand, even from afar.</p><br><p class="first">The harmony of the architecture and the surrounding scenery is particularly striking, with the church flanked by giant old trees under government protection. On the road leading to the church, visitors are welcomed by a 400-year-old hackberry tree. From the flower blossoms of spring to the colorful autumn foliage and naked branches during winter, the church presents unparalleled beauty throughout the changing seasons. Thanks to the wonderful scenery, the church has been featured in many movies and TV programs, making it widely known among followers of the Catholic faith and others.</p><br><p class="first">At the time of its establishment, Gongseri Catholic Church was not housed in a Western-style building as it is now. When it was first built in 1895, it was a traditional Korean building with 10 rooms under a tiled roof. Father Émile Pierre Devise, the first French missionary assigned to the church, constructed another Korean-style church in 1899—a unique building with a bell tower and tiled roof. In the 1920s, the church saw its congregation grow markedly. Father Devise, who was an architect and craftsman, designed a new church by himself, and construction was completed in 1922. The priest served in Gongseri for 35 years and contributed to the local community, helping poor tenant farmers and taking care of orphans.</p><br><p class="first">Anyone walking the paths around the church can learn the history and geographical features of the area. During the Joseon Dynasty, Gongseri was a harbor with a government warehouses for tribute grains, called <i>jochang</i>. The sea water flowed in right below the hill where the church stands, and on the east coast was a dock. Being the entrance to the Naepo area, the place is regarded as one of the most revered sites of the Korean Catholic Church. Naepo is the site of numerous persecutions and has produced many martyrs. Catholics make pilgrimages on the Way of the Cross with utmost piety, passing by the sculptural works symbolizing the 14 incidents from the condemnation and crucifixion to the death and burial of Jesus Christ. The path is a wonderful place to appreciate the sceneries of the changing seasons, but it also invites visitors to ponder the beauty and historic value of the Gongseri Catholic Church.</p><br><p class="first" style="text-align: right;">Written by Kim Moonyoung <br>Illustrated by EEWHA</p><div class="tags"><img src="http://newsletter.kf.or.kr/news/news_201804/images/sub_tag.png" alt=""><a href="http://knewsletter.kf.or.kr/search_newsletter.html?query=Catholic">Catholic</a><a href="http://knewsletter.kf.or.kr/search_newsletter.html?query=Gothic">Gothic</a><a href="http://knewsletter.kf.or.kr/search_newsletter.html?query=France">France</a><a href="http://knewsletter.kf.or.kr/search_newsletter.html?query=Mission">Mission</a></div></div></div><div class="center goTranslatePage"><a href="http://knewsletter.kf.or.kr/?menuno=6959">KOREAN</a></div><div class="center"><div class="share"><a href="https://twitter.com/home?status=http%3A//enewsletter.kf.or.kr/?menuno=6976" class="twitter" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A//enewsletter.kf.or.kr/?menuno=6976" class="facebook" target="_blank" style="margin-left: 4px;"></a></div></div></div></div>
